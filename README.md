# Anomaly Detection in Electricity Usage Patterns
CMPT318 (Cybersecurity Analytics) @ Simon Fraser University

# About
This Project is a semester-long study of Behaviour-Based Online Intrusion Detection. It is an essential concept utilized in mitigation and prevention of cyber threats to Critical Infrastructure Systems that rely on Automated Supervisory Control.
Methods are studied in the context of Anomaly Detection in Nationwide Electricity Usage Patterns.
