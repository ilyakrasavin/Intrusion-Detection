# Anomaly Detection in Electricity Usage Patterns
CMPT318 (Cybersecurity Analytics) @ Simon Fraser University

# About
This Project is a semester-long study of Behaviour-Based Online Intrusion Detection, essential in mitigation and prevention of cyber threats to Critical Infrastructure Systems that rely on Automated Supervisory Control.
The methods are approached from a viewpoint of Big Data Analytics.
Our team developed the framework for Anomaly Detection in Nationwide Electricity Usage Patterns.

## Part I - EDA
Basic Awareness of qualitative features and trends is developed for a sample fragment representing a single week of Electricity Consumption.
- Data Exploration
- Linear and Polynomial Model Fitting

## Part II - Unsupervised Intrusion Detection
Intraday Usage patterns are identified in a larger subset of data.
Univariate Hidden Markov Models are trained and studied for a single dimension.
Sample Anomaly Detection is deployed using Moving Averages Method.

## Part III - Unsupervised Intrusion Detection (Extended)
Multivariate Hidden Markov Models are studied on an extended 4-year period - multiple dimensions of a dataset are now taken into account.
This phase includes HMM training, testing and Anomaly Detection.


## Part IV - Term Project
The concluding phase is built on the experience with methods and knowledge acquired previously.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Feature Engineering
- Training and Testing
- Anomaly Detection
